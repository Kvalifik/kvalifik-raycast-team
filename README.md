🛠 Raycast Team Extensions — Kvalifik
Welcome to the private extension store of Kvalifik. This is where we collaborate on internal Raycast extensions to streamline our workflows, automate the boring stuff, and build tools that make our team faster and happier.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kvalifik/raycast-team-extensions.git

cd raycast-team-extensions

```

In Raycast, go to Extensions → Import Extension and select the folder you want to load.

Check for a README.md inside each extension folder for additional setup (e.g. API keys, .env files).

👯‍♂️ Team Collaboration
Use the Manage Organization command in Raycast to invite team members and collaborate on extensions.

Keep extensions modular and documented for easy onboarding.

If you add something new, open a PR and request feedback before merging.

✅ Conventions & Guidelines
Store each extension in its own folder

Avoid hardcoding secrets — use .env and .gitignore them

Keep UI clean and commands descriptive

Prefer clarity over cleverness
